# Parku API v4 Reference

The parku API is organized around REST. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use
HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs,
which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. JSON will be returned in all responses from the API,
including errors.
